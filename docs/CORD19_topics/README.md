# COVID-19 Topic Modeling

This folder contains topic modeling results for the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset [(CORD-19)](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research).

It extends the results described in the blog post [Organizing the Emerging COVID-19 Literature](https://roamanalytics.com/covid19-topics) (on v5 of the data).

## Results
- [cord19-2020-04-24-v9](cord19-2020-04-24-v9/) - Topic model results from 2020-04-24 (v9) version of the CORD-19 data set.

Disclaimer: These are preliminary results from works-in-progress based upon data collected by others which we are releasing in the hope they may help assist in on-going, public, collaborative efforts to organize and explore the rapidly emerging COVID-19 literature. We make no claim of validity or that it is fit for any purpose whatsoever. By design it will exclude potentially relevant articles.

Notebooks and code to generate the model are at https://github.com/roamanalytics/roamresearch/tree/master/BlogPosts/CORD19_topics/
