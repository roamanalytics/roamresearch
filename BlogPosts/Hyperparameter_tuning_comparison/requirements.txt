# For portability, numpy must be installed separately before running
#  `pip install -r requirements`. Different OSes may require different
#  installation procedures. We leave this numpy requirement here so
#  pip-sync does not uninstall numpy.
numpy == 1.10.4

matplotlib == 1.5.1
pandas == 0.18.0
scipy == 1.10.0

# See the README.md for the requirements associated with
